## JRPG Engine

### Note:
**I decided to re-create/defactor and start the whole project again from scratch using WebAssembly. This repository will be deleted and new one will be added soon enough.**

My passion- and hobby project for the moment. I know creating a game can take years, so i can't guarantee I some day finish it, but I'm determined to at least make a complete game engine, which includes
- Sprite graphics
- Tilemaps and tile-based movement
- Menu
- Semi-active-time battle system
- ...and more

Disclaimer: I have no prior experience on game development and this is my first Rust project. Code will be messy.
